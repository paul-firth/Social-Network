A simple social network site named "Social Pandas".

Mostly complete just a few small bugs remaining

Built in Laravel and using SQLite, the site allow user's to register, login, make posts, see and make comments on other posts, 
update and delete your own posts, search users and add friends.

Some of the routing has broken in the since I submitted this assignment and I'm unsure why and haven't yet had the chance to 
update it properly but will come back to this once I finish my other courses.
